					              <ul>
									<li>Our student clubs usually have activities on Friday afternoon at 1:00 at the room GH201. Here is the schedules of future and past events.</li>
									<li><h2>Schedule</h2><br>
									<h3>Mathematics Club</h3><br>
									Activities include math games, puzzles, discussions of mathematics
									related problems,
 									etc. Club members form the core of the Math Jeopardy Team! The team
									usually attends the Southeastern Section of the MAA 
									(Mathematical Association of America) conference and competition. </li>
									<li><h3>Computer Club</h3><br>
									Activities include analyzing/studying codes, developing programming projects, etc.
 									Club members are usually the core members of the team competing in the ACM 
									 (Association for Computing Machinery) Southeast USA Regional Intercollegiate 
 									Programming Contest. Our computer club is also a student chapter of ACM at AUM. </li>
									<li><h3>Engineering Club</h3><br>
									Activities include robotics, radio control plane,
									etc. Some members are also  members of the Math or
									Computer clubs. The club has an engineering lab.
									Students use the lab to perform experiments. The lab also houses 
									a Biodiesel system. The system can convert waste cooking oil 
									to biodiesel fuel. There is an annual engineering competition open 
									to students registered in the “Introduction to Engineering” class. 
									WindTurbine, electric motor bike, robotic arms, etc. are some past 
									competition projects. </li>
									<li><h3>Montgomery City Math Circle (MC)^2</h3><br>
									The first math circle in Greater Montgomery. 
									The  Circle is part of the National Association of Math Circle
									(www.mathcircles.org). The meetings are run and organized by local
									high school students supervised and sponsored by  AUM  Mathematics
									and Computer Science Department.  One of the goals is to guide local
									middle schoolers expand their mathematical knowledge outside of the 
									classroom, explore the inner     beauty of mathematics, and hone 
									their academic capabilities to excel both in school and competition.
									This is not a math tutorial service though.  For those who want
									to know about (MC)^2, please explore the circle page 
									www.montgomerycitymathcircle.weebly.com or contact
									Dr. Enoch Lee.</li>
